                <p>To ensure your scrambled cube matches that of the one displayed on screen of the trainer, apply the first rotation (e.g., <strong>z2</strong>) to your cube from the <strong>default orientation</strong> (White top, Green front) before applying the scramble.</p>
                
                <p>For the standard Western color scheme, <strong>z2</strong> means starting with <strong>Yellow top, Green front</strong>, instead of White Top, Green Front. This is ideal for CFOP solvers who solve on white cross but want to train cases from the yellow-top perspective.</p>

                <p>The second and third boxes define <strong>Color Neutrality</strong>. In this example, random <strong>x2</strong> and <strong>y</strong> rotations occur before each scramble. For Roux solvers, this corresponds to <strong>x2/y neutrality</strong>.</p>

                <p><em>Note:</em> For many algsets, rotating before the scramble doesn't affect how difficult a case can be recognzed. You can leave the random boxes blank to focus on a single orientation. The random orientation is perhaps more useful for virtual cube training, where all matters of preorientation are handled automatically.</p>
